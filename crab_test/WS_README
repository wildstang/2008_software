* Crab Drive
---- Left stick X controls crab angle for front and back
---- Right stick Y controls throttle

* Tank Drive
---- Left stick X - not used...must be centered
---- Right stick X/Y - Single stick differential drive
------ If Y is near the extremes, the X axis will engage car steering.
       In this mode, the X axis will cause the leading crab wheels to
       turn.  The amount of turn is based on the X axis as well as the
       wheel speed (based on encoders).  The faster the robot is moving,
       the smaller the effect car steering has.
       -- Note that the direction that the stick is pushed on the
       X axis corresponds to the direction that the robot will rotate.
       When driving forward, this is intuitive: car steering right will
       cause a clockwise rotation.  However, when driving backwards, 
       this becomes non-intuitive because car steering right will still
       cause a clockwise rotation of the robot (as opposed to the intuitive
       counter-clockwise rotation).  This needed to be done to avoid
       discontinuities between car steering and differential steering.
---- When crabbed, differential steering is not enabled

* Anti-Turbo
---- R2 provides momentary control of anti-turbo.  When not pressed, the maximum
     speed that the robot is allowed to drive at is scaled down (currently 1/2).
     When the button is pressed, the maximum speed is allowed.

* Landing Gear
---- L2 provides momentary control of the landing gear (pressed == extended)
---- When the landing gear is down, the maximum speed that the robot is allowed
     to run at is scaled down to provide more control when turning.
     (Currently 3/4)
---- When the landing gear is down, car steering is disabled

* Super-Crab
---- Normal crab only allows the crab modules to rotate 90 degrees in either
     direction.  Super-Crab allows for additional rotation (currently 30 degrees)
     when engaged
---- To engage Super-Crab, the crab stick should be positioned at the extreme
     X position (i.e. crabbing 90 degrees).  Once there, the stick can be pulled
     back to allow additional rotation.

* Manual crab override
---- There is a toggle switch on the OI that allows the driver to override the
     crab feedback 
     !!! This should only be used in emergencies if the feedback fails to avoid
     !!! damaging to the robot.
---- Once in manual override, the left drive stick controls the crab motors.
     When the stick is pushed forward, the front module is controlled by the
     left/right movement of the stick.  The motor will run at a speed
     proportional to the X position of the stick.  Similarly, the back module
     is controlled when the stick is pulled back.

* Theta correction
---- Theta correction uses the onboard gyro (read via the custom circuit) to
     try to counteract any undesirable changes in orientation.
---- There is a toggle switch on the OI panel that will enable/disable theta
     correction (If there is no onboard gyro or CC, the swith should be set to
     disable)
---- When enabled, theta correction works automatically as follows:
     -- When the robot is commanded to drive straight (small deadzone on the X
        axis), the current orientation is latched.  If the gyro reports skew,
        the leading crab modules will counteract the change.  If at any time the
        X axis of the drive stick moves outside the deadzone, theta correction
        will not take effect.
     -- Theta correction works when crabbed at any angle

* Dynamic braking
---- This feature will allow the robot to set the drive speed controllers to
     brake mode while driving at slow speeds based on wheel encoder counts.
     This will provide additional resistance within the drivetrain when the
     driver's intention is to not move.

* Arm Control
---- Right Stick Y - Shoulder control.  Pulling back will raise the shoulder
     from the home position.  Speed is proportional to the Y axis
---- Left Stick Y - Elbow control.  Pushing forward will open the elbow from
     the home position.  Speed is proportional to the Y axis
---- D-Pad Left/Right - Rotate control.  Speed is always set to full, however,
     there is some acceleration in place to help with finer control.
---- X button - Telescope - Software sticky control of the telescopre that acts
     on the press of the button and toggles state (in/out) with each press.
     Several safety measures are in place with the telescope.
     -- If the button is pressed while disabled, the transition is ignored
     -- If the telescope is out, and the robot is disabled, the state will
        be set to in.
     Both of these measures prevent the telescope from extending unexpectedly
     when the robot is enabled.
---- Gripper control
     -- L2 button - Gripper Open - When pressed, the state of the grippers is
        set to open.
     -- R2 button - Gripper Close - When pressed, the state of the grippers is
        set to closed
     -- Similar safety measures exist on the grippers to protect against 
        unexpected opening when the robot is enabled.
* Automatic control
---- Automated control is based on a final end position of the arm.  The arm
     will move the necessary joints based on pot feedback and constraints to
     get to the desired position.  Once at the position, the feedback loops
     will try to maintain that position
---- Currently, the following positions are programmed:
     -- Square - Pick up from the floor
     -- Triangle - Home position
     -- Circle - Pick up from human player
     -- L1-Square - Score Low (not needed anymore)
     -- L1-Triangle - Score Middle
     -- L1-Circle - Score High
     -- Proposed change:
        -- Circle - Pick up from human player left
        -- L1-Square - Score Middle
        -- L1-Triangle - Score High
        -- L1-Circle - Pick up from human player right
---- As soon as a manual movement of any arm actuator is made, the automated
     loop is exited.
---- It should be noted that the automated positions will get close to the
     desired position, but will still require manual movement to complete the
     action (i.e. moving the elbow to score, opening grippers, etc)

* Constraints
---- There are software limits that may limit the movement of arm actuators
     based on the arm pots.
---- Currently, there are only constraints in place at the enpoints of each
     joint.

* Arm feedback override
---- There is a toggle switch on the OI that enables/disables arm feedback.
     When this is set to disable, the robot will not look at any of the pot
     feedback when moving the arm.  Manual controls will remain the same,
     however, no constraints will be applied.  None of the automatic positions
     will function in this state.

* Ramp release
---- There is a toggle switch on the OI that will release the ramp.
---- Since this is a one-shot deployment, the following safeties are in place:
     -- If the switch is on when enabled, do not deploy the ramp until the
        switch is set first set to off
     -- Deploy the ramp only if the switch has been set for more than 10
        software loops (~0.2 seconds).

* Tower release
---- There is a toggle switch on the OI that will release the tower.
---- Since this is a one-shot deployment, the following safeties are in place:
     -- If the switch is on when enabled, do not deploy the ramp until the
        switch is set first set to off
     -- Deploy the ramp only if the switch has been set for more than 10
        software loops (~0.2 seconds).

* Joystick calibration
---- When the OI debug switch is put in joystick mode, the output of the
     joysticks can be read on the OI 7-seg display when the OI is in user mode
     (press select until the first character is a 'u')  This is useful for
     debugging joystick input
---- To activate for an analog stick, move the stick all the way to either the
     top or left depending on which axis is being looked at.

* Pot calibration
---- When the OI debug switch is put in pot mode, there are two modes of
     operation
     -- Debug - Displays the values of various pots on the OI 7-seg display
     -- Calibrate - Allows the arm to be calibrated and the calibration values
        to be stored in EEPROM for further use.
---- Debugging
     -- Arm pots - Move the stick that corresponds to the pot in question all
        the way to the top if it is an analog stick, or D-Pad left if it is
        controlled by the D-pad.  The value displayed at the OI is the current
        value of the pot.  As the joint is moved, the value should change
        accordingly
     -- Crab pots - Moving the stick forward will debug the front crab pot
        and moving it backwards will debug the back.
---- Calibration
     -- Crab pots
        -- There are three calibration values associated with the crab pots:
           left, center, right.
        -- Position the crab module so that it is 90 degrees to the left,
           right, or centered.  Press the calibration sequence on the drive
           controller to calibrate that module in that position
           -- Crab stick Y determines front/back module
           -- Crab stick X determines left/center/right position
           -- With the stick in position, press L1
     -- Arm pots 
        -- Each arm joint needs to be calibrated for the end of travel.
           With the robot disabled, and the joint at the extreme, hold the
           arm joystick associated with the joint in the direction that would
           cause the joint to drive past the endpoint.  With the joystick held,
           press the calibration button associated with the joint.
           -- Square - Rotate
           -- Triangle - Elbow
           -- Circle - Shoulder
        -- To calculate the middle point of all three joints, position the arm
           so the shoulder is parallel to the ground, the elbow is perfectly
           straight, and the rotation is not rotated.  Press the combination of
           L2, R2, and X to calculate the midpoint for all
